                                "content": "<strong>A Tour of the Solar System<br/> <br/> Part One</strong><br/> <br/> Twelve-year-old Emma reached out and touched the sleeve of her mother's shirt. She could see blue waves on the white fabric. The stitches bumped against her fingertips as she touched them. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Mom, is this the shirt that you made yourself,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;or is that a different one?&rdquo;<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Yes, this is it,&rdquo; her mother answered. &ldquo;Get ready, I think they're almost ready to start.&rdquo;<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>Emma looked out the window of the spacecraft. She could see the deep blue of the Atlantic Ocean as Earth slowly spun far below. A flight attendant came by to check her seatbelt one last time.<br/> <br/> Emma felt herself pushed against her seat as the ship sped away from the space station. She saw a blur of stars through the porthole as their vessel raced through space.<br/> &nbsp;</p> In what seemed like a minute, Emma's view of Earth was replaced by a dusty, reddish-brown planet. Now Emma could see craters of different sizes all over the surface.<br/> &nbsp; <p>&ldquo;Let us be the first to welcome you to Mars!&rdquo; the pilot said over Emma's headset. &ldquo;Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and over 200 million miles from Earth.&rdquo;<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>Emma watched as Mars slowly rotated in the same way that Earth had. A long, dark band on the planet's surface appeared. She stopped an attendant as he passed by.<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; she asked.<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The dark streak? Those are volcanic rocks. Mars has volcanoes just like back on Earth.&rdquo;<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>Back on Earth, Emma thought. We're already so far from home! What could be next?<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Are you cold, sweetie?&rdquo; her mother asked.<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;No . . . but do you know if it's hot on Mars? It looks like the desert!&rdquo;<br/> &nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Actually, it's freezing,&rdquo; her mother laughed. &ldquo;I was reading that Mars can be colder than the coldest place on Earth!&rdquo;<br/> <br/> <strong>Part Two</strong></p> <br/> &ldquo;Please keep your seatbelts fastened as we pass through the asteroid belt,&rdquo; the pilot's voice said over the speakers. The spacecraft carried Emma and her mother deeper into the solar system. &ldquo;The asteroid belt separates the smaller planets from the more massive ones. Our ride has been smooth so far, but it might be a little bumpy for a few minutes!&rdquo;<br/> <br/> When the spacecraft slowed again, Emma peered out of her window, only to see a cloud of dull gray through her porthole. She felt a ball of fear deep in her stomach. Where were they? Had something gone wrong?<br/> <br/> &ldquo;Mom, what is this? Where are we?&rdquo;<br/> <br/> &ldquo;That's Jupiter. It looks strange from here because the surface is all gas.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br/> <br/> Emma took a deep breath. She would feel better when she was home safe on Earth. But for now she would do her best to enjoy her solar system adventure.<br/> <br/> As they continued passing the gas giant, Emma studied the bright, colorful surface that came into view. A mix of white, pink, gray, and red layers swirled around. Finally, Emma noticed a huge rust-colored spot, staring at her like an eye from the surface of the planet.<br/> <br/> &ldquo;There's Jupiter's Great Red Spot!&rdquo; she said, pointing with excitement.<br/> &nbsp;<br/> &ldquo;Believe it or not, it's actually a huge storm,&rdquo; her mom said. &ldquo;Can you imagine that?&rdquo;<br/> <br/> The spacecraft began to speed away from Jupiter. The stars in Emma's window blurred again, and soon the passengers were admiring the enormous rings of Saturn. They continued their tour, stopping at the planets of Uranus and Neptune, as well as the dwarf planet, Pluto. At each stop, there was something for Emma to ask about, but she mostly watched in wonder.<br/> <br/> Finally, Emma saw a familiar sight in her window: the blue waters of Earth. She noticed for the first time that the color of the oceans matched her mother's shirt almost perfectly!&nbsp;<br/> <br/> Home! She thought. Safe and sound. This was the first and last stop in their incredible&mdash;though sometimes scary&mdash;tour of the solar system.",
